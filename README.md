# Overlay-NFS

## Description

This project will be to extend my fledgling Overlay-NFS project (an implementation of Overlayfs over NFS), so that it can be used as an replacement for overlayfs. Features still needed: permission handling (if possible, I'm not sure if NFS supports the idea of users), comprehensive test suite, and anything else I think of.

## (Intended) User Profile

Any user who wants to use overlayfs, but does not use Linux (this is mostly directed towards macOS, but any *nix should be compatible).
